Error Handling & Logging\\n\\n### Error Handling\\n- Log failed attempts to reset the password with a timestamp and error code.\\n- Implement retry logic for failed email notifications.\\n\\n## 16. Deployment & Environment Details\\n\\n### CI/CD Pipeline\\n- Deployed via AWS Lambda, API Gateway, SES, and RDS.\\n- CI/CD pipeline set up through AWS CodePipeline with Terraform for infrastructure management.\\n\\n## 17. Assumptions & Dependencies\\n\\n### Assumptions\\n- External SMTP services are used as a backup for email delivery in case AWS SES fails.\\n\\n### Dependencies\\n- **AWS Lambda**: For backend logic processing.\\n- **AWS RDS**: For relational database management.\\n- **AWS SES**: For email notifications.\\n- **AWS SNS**: For notifications and alerts.\\n\\n## 18. Risks & Mitigation Strategies\\n\\n### Risks\\n- Risk: Token validation failure due to incorrect configurations.\\n- Mitigation: Provide clear logging and debugging tools for administrators.\\n\\n## 19. Appendix\\n\\n### Additional Notes\\n- Ensure compliance with GDPR, PCI-DSS, and other relevant standards.\\n- Maintain detailed documentation for each module and component.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis document provides a comprehensive and detailed technical design for the PayMate application, ensuring clarity and precision. It covers key design aspects, security, performance, and deployment strategies, and follows industry best practices.'"
